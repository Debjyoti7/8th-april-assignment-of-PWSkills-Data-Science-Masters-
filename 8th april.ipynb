    "## When developing an SVM regression model to predict house prices based on several characteristics, there are several regression metrics that can be used to evaluate the model's performance. Some of the commonly used regression metrics for SVM regression models include:\n",
    "## 1. Mean squared error (MSE): The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes large errors more than smaller ones, which makes it a good metric for models where large errors are considered more important.\n",
    "## 2. Mean absolute error (MAE): The MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers than MSE and can be a better metric if the distribution of errors is not normal.\n",
    "## 3. R-squared (R2): The R2 measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.\n",
    "## In the case of predicting house prices, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric would be a good metric to employ. This is because predicting the correct house price is of paramount importance, and large errors in the predicted values should be penalized. Additionally, the MSE is widely used in the literature for regression tasks and is easy to interpret. However, it is always a good practice to evaluate the model using multiple metrics and choose the one that is most suitable for the specific use case."

    "## Furthermore, since the RMSE takes the square root of the MSE, it is more sensitive to larger errors, which can be particularly important when dealing with regression models that have a polynomial kernel. Polynomial kernels are known to be more prone to overfitting, and larger errors may indicate that the model is not generalizing well to new data.\n",
